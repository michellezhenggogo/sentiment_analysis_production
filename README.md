# sentiment_analysis

This project focuses on developing a sentiment analysis system from social media posts. Using state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques, the system automatically identifies and categorizes the sentiment expressed within social media content. 

The code compares two distinct approaches:
	
 •	Traditional TF-IDF + Machine Learning Models(SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM)
	
 •	Deep Learning using BERT
